;;; helm-org-rifle.el --- Rifle through your Org files

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; Url: http://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle
;; Package-Version: 20160329.1353
;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4") (helm "1.9.3") (s "1.10.0"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines

;;; Commentary:

;; This is my rifle.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.
;; My rifle is my best friend. It is my life.  I must master it as I
;; must master my life.

;; What does my rifle do?  It searches rapidly through my Org files,
;; quickly bringing me the information I need to defeat the enemy.

;; This package is a continuation of the fantastic
;; org-search-goto/org-search-goto-ml packages, now with Helm
;; support. It searches both headings and contents of entries in Org
;; buffers, and it displays entries that match all search terms,
;; whether the terms appear in the heading, the contents, or both.
;; Matching portions of entries' contents are displayed with
;; surrounding context to make it easy to acquire your target.

;; Entries are fontified by default to match the appearance of an Org
;; buffer, and optionally the entire path can be displayed for each
;; entry, rather than just its own heading.

;;; Installation

;; Install the Helm and "s" (aka "s.el") packages.  Then require this
;; package in your init file:

;; (require 'helm-org-rifle)

;; Then you can customize the `helm-org-rifle' group if you like.

;;; Usage

;; Run one of the rifle commands, type some words, and results will be
;; displayed, grouped by buffer.  Hit "RET" to show the selected
;; entry, or <C-return> to show it in an indirect buffer.

;; Commands:
;; + `helm-org-rifle': Shows results from all open Org buffers
;; + `helm-org-rifle-current-buffer': Shows results from current buffer

;;; Tips

;; + Show results from certain buffers by typing the name of the
;;   buffer (usually the filename).
;; + Show headings with certain todo keywords by typing the keyword,
;;   e.g. =TODO= or =DONE=.
;; + Show headings with certain priorities by typing, e.g. =#A= or
;;   =[#A]=.
;; + Show headings with certain tags by searching for, e.g. =:tag1:=.
;; + Exclude results with a =!=, e.g. =pepperoni !anchovies=.
;; + Show entries in an indirect buffer by selecting that action from
;;   the Helm actions list.

;;; Credits:

;; This package is based on org-search-goto (specifically,
;; org-search-goto-ml).  Its unofficial-official home is on
;; EmacsWiki[1] but I've mirrored it on GitHub[2].  It's a really
;; great package, and the only thing that could make it better is to
;; make it work with Helm.  To avoid confusion, this package has a
;; completely different name.

My rifle is my best friend.  It is my life.  I must master it as I
must master my life.

Without me, my rifle is useless.  Without my rifle, I am
useless.  I must fire my rifle true.  I must shoot straighter than
my enemy who is trying to kill me.  I must shoot him before he
shoots me.  I will...

My rifle and I know that what counts in war is not the rounds we
fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make.  We know that
it is the hits that count.  We will hit...

My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life.  Thus, I will
learn it as a brother.  I will learn its weaknesses, its strength,
its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel.  I will
keep my rifle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.  We
will become part of each other.  We will...

Before God, I swear this creed.  My rifle and I are the defenders
of my country.  We are the masters of our enemy.  We are the
saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is ours and there is no enemy, but
