dired-efap.el allows the user to edit the filename at point, by hitting
a key (like f2) or double-clicking it.  The name is edited in the dired
buffer, and the renaming takes effect when the user hits the RET
key.  Only the name of the file at point is tangible and editable, and it
uses an special font.

This package provides a similar user interface to renaming files to the
interface used by some graphical file managers (or "explorers", however they
are called).

The idea for this file was originated from a suggestion I received from Eli
Tziperman to improve wdired.

Comments, bug reports and ideas welcomed
