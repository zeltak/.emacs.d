;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package is aimed on minimizing the effort of interacting with
;; the command tools involved in transforming files.
;;
;; For instance, once in a blue moon you might need to transform a
;; large flac file based on a cue file into smaller flac files, or mp3
;; files for that matter.
;;
;; Case 1: if you're doing it for the first time, you'll search the
;; internet for a command tool that does this job, and for particular
;; switches.
;;
;; Case 2: you've done it before.  The problem is that when you want to
;; do the transform for the second time, you have likely forgotten all
;; the command switches and maybe even the command itself.
;;
;; The solution is to write the command to a Makefile when you find it
;; the first time around.  This particular Makefile you should save to
;; ./recipes/cue/split/Makefile.
;;
;; Case 3: you have a Makefile recipe.  Just navigate to the dispatch
;; file (*.cue in this case) with `dired' and press "," which is bound
;; to `make-it-so'.  You'll be prompted to select a transformation
;; recipe that applies to *.cue files.  Select "split".  The following
;; steps are:
;;
;;   1. A staging directory will be created in place of the input
;;   files and they will be moved there.
;;
;;   2. Your selected Makefile template will be copied to the staging
;;   directory and opened for you to tweak the parameters.
;;
;;   3. When you're done, call `compile' to make the transformation.
;;   It's bound to [f5] in `make-mode' by this package.
;;
;;   4. If you want to cancel at this point, discarding the results of
;;   the transformation (which is completely safe, since they can be
;;   regenerated), call `mis-abort', bound to "C-M-,".
;;
;;   5. If you want to keep both the input and output files, call
;;   `mis-finalize', bound to "C-,".
;;
;;   6. If you want to keep only the output files, call `mis-replace',
;;   bound to "C-M-.".  The original files will be moved to trash.
;;
;;   7. Finally, consider contributing Makefile recipes to allow
;;   other users to skip Case 1 and Case 2.
