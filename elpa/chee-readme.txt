This is an interface to the chee program. Chee is a command line
tool for managing photos. This package provides a buffer to
conveniently execute the chee program. The results are displayed
using dired and image-dired.

Please see https://github.com/eikek/chee and
https://github.com/eikek/chee/tree/master/emacs for more
information.

Use this package by invoking `chee-query-open'. A few things can be
configured, but it is not necessary; see customize-group 'chee' for
options. The function `chee-setup-default' adds a key binding for
`chee-query-open' to `C-c C-s'.
