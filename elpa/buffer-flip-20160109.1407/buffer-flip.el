;; Inspired by Alt-Tab.  Quickly flip through recently-used buffers.

(define-minor-mode buffer-flip-mode
  "A global minor mode that streamlines the operation of
switching between recent buffers, with an emphasis on minimizing
keystrokes.  Inspired by the Alt-Tab convention in Windows, it
keeps the most recently used buffers on the top of the stack.
Depends on `key-chord-mode'.

By default, the key chord to begin flipping through buffers is
\"u8\".  You can customize these keys with the variable
`buffer-flip-keys'.

\"u\" and \"8\" are roughly analogous to Alt and Tab,
respectively.  To begin cycling through the buffers, press u and
8 at the same time or in rapid succession, `key-chord' style.
This begins the flipping process by switching to the most
recently used buffer.  At this point, pressing \"8\" by itself
will continue to cycle through the buffer stack, more recent
buffers first.  Pressing * (shift-8 on an English keyboard) will
cycle in the opposite direction.  Just begin working in the
current buffer to stop cycling.  Doing so places the current
buffer on top of the stack.  C-g cancels cycling and restores the
buffer you were in before, analagous to Esc when cycling in
Windows."

The first two characters form the key-chord that begins buffer
cycling.  They are automatically registered with `key-chord` when
set this variable is customized.  The second character pressed on
its own continues cycling in the forward direction.  The third
character cycles in the backward direction.  This would typically
be the shifted version of the second character.  These may not be
modifier keys, and because of a restriction in key-chord, they
must be characters between 32 and 126.  Choose a key combination
not likely to be used in succession in normal editing."
