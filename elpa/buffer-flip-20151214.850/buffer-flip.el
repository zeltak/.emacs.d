(define-minor-mode buffer-flip-mode
  "A global minor mode that lets you flip through buffers like
Alt-Tab in Windows, keeping the most recently used buffers on
the top of the stack.  Depends on `key-chord-mode'.

By default, the key chord to begin flipping through buffers is
\"u8\".  You can customize these keys with the variable
`buffer-flip-keys'.

\"u\" and \"8\" are roughly analogous to Alt and Tab,
respectively.  To begin cycling through the buffers, press u and
8 at the same time or in rapid succession, `key-chord' style.
This will flip to the second buffer in the stack returned by
`buffer-list'.  Repeatedly pressing \"8\" will continue to cycle
through the buffers.  Pressing * (shift-8) will cycle in the
opposite direction.  Just begin working in a buffer to stop
cycling.  C-g cancels cycling and restores the buffer you were in
before, analagous to Esc when cycling in Windows."

The first two characters form the key-chord that begins buffer
cycling.  The second character pressed on its own continues
cycling in the forward direction.  The third character cycles in
the backward direction.  This would typically be the shifted
version of the second character.  These may not be modifier keys,
and because of a restriction in key-chord, they must be
characters between 32 and 126.  Choose a key combination not
likely to be used in succession in normal editing."
