The goal here is reuse frames and windows as much as possible, so
we're not opening multiple windows on the *Group* buffer, for
instance, and messing up people's layouts. There also seems to be
an issue when opening a link to a message whose *Summary* buffer
is already visible: somehow, after following the link, point ends
up on the message _after_ the one we want, and things go haywire.

So we try to be a little clever. The logical progression here is
this:

1. If the link's target group is already open in a *Summary*
buffer, just switch to that buffer (if it's visible in any frame
then raise it and switch focus, otherwise pull it into the
current window) and go to the message with
`gnus-summary-goto-article'.

2. If the Gnus *Group* buffer is visible in any window or frame,
raise that frame/window and give it focus before following the
link.

3. Otherwise just follow the link as usual, in the current
window."
