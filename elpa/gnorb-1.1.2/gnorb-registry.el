;;; Commentary:

;; Early on, Gnorb's message/todo tracking was done by relying on the
;; user to insert links to received messages into an Org heading, and
;; by automatically storing the Message-Ids of sent messages in a
;; property (`gnorb-org-msg-id-key', defaulting to GNORB_MSG_ID) on
;; the same heading. The heading could find all relevant messages by
;; combining the links (incoming) and the IDs of the Gnorb-specific
;; property (outgoing).
;;
;; In the end, this proved to be fragile and messy. Enter the
;; registry. The Gnus registry is a specialization of a general
;; "registry" library -- it's possible to roll your own. If you want
;; to track connections between messages and Org headings, it's an
;; obvious choice: Each relevant message is stored in the registry,
;; keyed on its Message-ID, and the org-ids of all relevant headings
;; are stored in a custom property, in our case gnorb-ids. This allows
;; us to keep all Gnorb-specific data in one place, without polluting
;; Org files or Gnus messages, persistent on disk, and with the added
;; bonus of providing a place to keep arbitrary additional metadata.
;;
;; The drawback is that the connections are no longer readily visible
;; to the user (they need to query the registry to see them), and it
;; becomes perhaps a bit more difficult (but only a bit) to keep
;; registry data in sync with the current state of the user's Gnus and
;; Org files. But a clear win, in the end.
