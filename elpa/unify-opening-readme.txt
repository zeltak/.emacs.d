Make everything use the same mechanism to open files. Currently,
`dired` has its mechanism, `org-mode` uses something different (the
`org-file-apps` variable), and `mu4e` something else (a simple
prompt). This package makes sure that each package uses the
mechanism of `dired`. I advise you to install the
[`runner`](https://github.com/thamer/runner) package to improve the
`dired` mechanism.
