This is package to do text folding like in Vim. It has the following
features:

* batteries included: activate minor mode, bind a couple of commands and
  everything will just work;

* it works on regions you select;

* it's persistent: when you close file your folds don't disappear;

* in addition to being persistent, it scales well, you can work on
  hundreds of files with lots of folds without adverse effects;

* it's obvious which parts of text are folded;

* it doesn't break indentation or something;

* it can refold just unfolded folds (oh, my);

* for fans of `avy' package: you can use `avy' to fold text with minimal
  number of key strokes!
