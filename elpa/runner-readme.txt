This library allows for a set of shell commands to be linked to
file or directory names. These commands can then be used in dired
mode using `dired-do-shell-command' (or pressing "!"). Since this
library modifies the behavior of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user',
the command syntax will follow that variable's syntax (see the
documentation of `dired-do-shell-command' for more).
