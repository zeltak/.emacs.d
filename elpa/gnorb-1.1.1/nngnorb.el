;;; Commentary:

;; This is a backend for supporting Gnorb-related stuff. I'm going to
;; regret this, I know.

;; It started off just with wanting to collect all the gnus links in a
;; subtree, and display all the messages in an ephemeral group. But it
;; doesn't seem possible to create ephemeral groups without
;; associating them with a server, and which server would that be?
;; Nnir also provides a nice interface to creating ephemeral groups,
;; but again, it relies on a server parameter to know which nnir
;; engine to use, and if you try to fake it it still craps out.

;; So this file is a copy-pasta from nnnil.el -- I'm trying to keep
;; this as simple as possible. Right now it does nothing but serving
;; as a place to hang ephemeral groups made with nnir searches of
;; message from the rest of your gnus installation. Enjoy.

  "Run the actual search for messages to display. See nnir.el for
some details of how this gets called.

As things stand, the query string can be given as one of two
different things. First is the ID string of an Org heading,
prefixed with \"id+\". This was probably a bad choice as it could
conceivably look like an org tags search string. Fix that later.
If it's an ID, then the entire subtree text of that heading is
scanned for gnus links, and the messages relevant to the subtree
are collected from the registry, and all the resulting messages
are displayed in an ephemeral group.

Otherwise, the query string can be a tags match string, a la the
Org agenda tags search. All headings matched by this string will
be scanned for gnus messages, and those messages displayed."
  ;; During the transition period between using message-ids stored in
  ;; a property, and the new registry-based system, we're going to use
  ;; both methods to collect relevant messages. This could be a little
