   Buttons extension for the Sunrise Commander file manager.

This package is an enhancement for the Sunrise Commander, which is a
two-pane file manager, like Midnight Commander or Total Commander.

It may be of help to new users who want to get acquainted fast with
the most frequent functions found in the Sunrise Commander and their
keybindings.

Once installed, it displays a panel with mouse clickable buttons that
show some of the most useful actions performed by Sunrise and their
respective bindings in the bottom window (a.k.a. the "viewer") every
time the main panels are invoked.  You can of course execute any of
these functions by clicking on the appropriate button, but the
extension was conceived more as a simple cheat sheet (a very, very
limited one, as you can easily learn by pressing the last button,
labeled "More...")  than as a real interface to Sunrise and Dired
functions. Eventually, if you like this kind of interaction with the
program you can add your own commands to the list and let this
extension manage the creation and layout of the buttons for you.
