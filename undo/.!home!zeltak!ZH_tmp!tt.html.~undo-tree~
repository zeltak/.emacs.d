Satellite data expand spatial coverage, enhancing our ability to estimate near surface air temperature (Ta). However, the derivation of Ta from surface temperature (Ts) measured by satellites is far from being straightforward. In this study, we present a novel approach that incorporates land use regression, meteorological variables and spatial smoothing to first calibrate between Ts and Ta on a daily basis and then predict Ta for days when satellite Ts data were not available. We applied mixed regression models with daily random slopes to calibrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} Ts data with monitored Ta measurements for 2003. Then, we used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate Ta in days with missing Ts. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample R2\\&\\#xa0;=\\&\\#xa0;0.946 and R2\\&\\#xa0;=\\&\\#xa0;0.941 respectively). Furthermore, based on the high quality predictions we investigated the spatial patterns of Ta within the study domain as they relate to urban vs. non-urban land uses.\",\"\",\"Air temperature, Epidemiology, Exposure error, {MODIS}, Surface temperature\",\"\",\"\"

In addition all these studies have relied on a limited number of {PM2.5} monitors in their study regions, which introduces exposure error, and excludes rural and suburban populations from locations in which monitors are not available, reducing generalizability and potentially creating selection {bias.MethodsUsing} our novel prediction models for exposure combining land use regression with physical measurements (satellite aerosol optical depth) we investigated both the long and short term effects of {PM2.5} exposures on hospital admissions across New-England for all residents aged 65 and older. We performed separate Poisson regression analysis for each admission type: all respiratory, cardiovascular disease ({CVD)}, stroke and diabetes. Daily admission counts in each zip code were regressed against long and short-term {PM2.5} exposure, temperature, socio-economic data and a spline of time to control for seasonal trends in baseline {risk.ResultsWe} observed associations between both short-term and long-term exposure to {PM2.5} and hospitalization for all of the outcomes examined. In example, for respiratory diseases, for every10-����g/m3 increase in short-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 0.70 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������0.35 to 0.52) while concurrently for every10-����g/m3 increase in long-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 4.22 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������1.06 to {4.75).ConclusionsAs} with mortality studies, chronic exposure to particles is associated with substantially larger increases in hospital admissions than acute exposure and both can be detected simultaneously using our exposure models.\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"

Satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements have the potential to provide spatio-temporally resolved predictions of both long and short term exposures, but previous studies have generally showed relatively low predictive power. Our objective was to extend our previous work on day-specific calibrations of {AOD} data using ground {PM2.5} measurements by incorporating commonly used {LUR} variables and meteorological variables, thus benefiting from both the spatial resolution from the {LUR} models and the spatio-temporal resolution from the satellite models. Later we use spatial smoothing to predict {PM2.5} concentrations for day/locations with missing {AOD} measures. We used mixed models with random slopes for day to calibrate {AOD} data for 2000������2008 across New-England with monitored {PM2.5} measurements. We then used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate {PM2.5} in location������day pairs with missing {AOD}, using regional measured {PM2.5}, {AOD} values in neighboring cells, and land use. Finally, local (100����m) land use terms were used to model the difference between grid cell prediction and monitored value to capture very local traffic particles. Out-of-sample ten-fold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. For days with available {AOD} data we found high out-of-sample R2 (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.830, year to year variation 0.725������0.904). For days without {AOD} values, our model performance was also excellent (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.810, year to year variation 0.692������0.887). Importantly, these R2 are for daily, rather than monthly or yearly, values. Our model allows one to assess short term and long-term human exposures in order to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of ambient particles, respectively.\",\"\",\"Aerosol optical depth, Epidemiology, Exposure error, LAN, air pollution, {PM2.5}\",\"\",\"\"

Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements offer the possibility of exposure estimates for the entire population. We previously demonstrated that daily calibration substantially increased the predictive power of satellite {AOD} measurements for fine particles ({PM2.5)} in New England, allowing estimation of exposure in locations without monitors. Similar results have not been reported for larger particles ({PM10)}, which are often the only measures that can be used in locations worldwide that do not have comprehensive {PM2.5} monitoring; this also applies to {PM} estimation of historical exposures. Here we extend this methodology by applying it to 2000������2009 {PM10} data from Lombardy, Northern Italy a region with high altitude differences, frequent temperature inversions and stationary fronts. Specifically, by 1) incorporating a model for missing {AOD} data to deal with non-randomness in the missing data; and 2) modeling interactions between land use and meteorological parameters to better capture space������time interactions. We calibrated {AOD} data through mixed-effect models regressing {PM10} measurements using day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random {AOD} and temperature slopes. We used inverse-probability weighting to account for nonrandom {AOD} missingness, while reducing the dimensionality of spatial and temporal predictors and avoiding selecting different predictors in different locations, as common in land-use regression. We take advantage of associations of grid-cell {AOD} values with {PM10} monitoring located elsewhere and with {AOD} values in neighboring grid cells to develop grid-cell predictions when {AOD} is missing. By using ten-fold cross-validation to test the accuracy of our predictions, we found high out-of-sample R2 (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.738������0.818) for days with available {AOD} data. Even in days with no available {AOD}, our model performance was comparable (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.736������0.841). Our results demonstrate that {PM10} can be reliably predicted using this {AOD-based} prediction model, even in a geographical area with complex geographic and weather patterns.\",\"\",\"Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)}, air pollution, Epidemiology, Exposure error, {PM10}\",\"\",\"\"

  Abstract                 = {The kernel density ({KD)} function estimates the intensity of events across a surface by calculating the overall number of cases situated within a given search radius from a target point. To form a continuous surface from individual observations, the {KD} technique does not require the presence of a parameter{\\^{a}}����s value in a given location (e.g., the incidence rate of a disease). This feature of {KD} smoothing is especially beneficial for empirical studies in which individual observations are represented by geographic coordinates only and have no other attributes, required by more commonly used smoothing techniques, such as spline and kriging. In the present study, we illustrate the use of {KD} technique for a study of association between the geographical distributions of breast cancer cases and exposure to artificial illumination during nighttime (light-at-night or {LAN)} in the city of Haifa, Israel.},

  Abstract                 = {Land use regression ({LUR)} models provide good estimates of spatially resolved long-term exposures, but are poor at capturing short term exposures. Satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements have the potential to provide spatio-temporally resolved predictions of both long and short term exposures, but previous studies have generally showed relatively low predictive power. Our objective was to extend our previous work on day-specific calibrations of {AOD} data using ground {PM2.5} measurements by incorporating commonly used {LUR} variables and meteorological variables, thus benefiting from both the spatial resolution from the {LUR} models and the spatio-temporal resolution from the satellite models. Later we use spatial smoothing to predict {PM2.5} concentrations for day/locations with missing {AOD} measures. We used mixed models with random slopes for day to calibrate {AOD} data for 2000������2008 across New-England with monitored {PM2.5} measurements. We then used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate {PM2.5} in location������day pairs with missing {AOD}, using regional measured {PM2.5}, {AOD} values in neighboring cells, and land use. Finally, local (100����m) land use terms were used to model the difference between grid cell prediction and monitored value to capture very local traffic particles. Out-of-sample ten-fold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. For days with available {AOD} data we found high out-of-sample R2 (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.830, year to year variation 0.725������0.904). For days without {AOD} values, our model performance was also excellent (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.810, year to year variation 0.692������0.887). Importantly, these R2 are for daily, rather than monthly or yearly, values. Our model allows one to assess short term and long-term human exposures in order to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of ambient particles, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Although meteorological stations provide accurate air temperature observations, their spatial coverage is limited and thus often insufficient for epidemiological studies. Satellite data expand spatial coverage, enhancing our ability to estimate near surface air temperature (Ta). However, the derivation of Ta from surface temperature (Ts) measured by satellites is far from being straightforward. In this study, we present a novel approach that incorporates land use regression, meteorological variables and spatial smoothing to first calibrate between Ts and Ta on a daily basis and then predict Ta for days when satellite Ts data were not available. We applied mixed regression models with daily random slopes to calibrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} Ts data with monitored Ta measurements for 2003. Then, we used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate Ta in days with missing Ts. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample R2\\&\\#xa0;=\\&\\#xa0;0.946 and R2\\&\\#xa0;=\\&\\#xa0;0.941 respectively). Furthermore, based on the high quality predictions we investigated the spatial patterns of Ta within the study domain as they relate to urban vs. non-urban land uses.},

In addition all these studies have relied on a limited number of {PM2.5} monitors in their study regions, which introduces exposure error, and excludes rural and suburban populations from locations in which monitors are not available, reducing generalizability and potentially creating selection {bias.MethodsUsing} our novel prediction models for exposure combining land use regression with physical measurements (satellite aerosol optical depth) we investigated both the long and short term effects of {PM2.5} exposures on hospital admissions across New-England for all residents aged 65 and older. We performed separate Poisson regression analysis for each admission type: all respiratory, cardiovascular disease ({CVD)}, stroke and diabetes. Daily admission counts in each zip code were regressed against long and short-term {PM2.5} exposure, temperature, socio-economic data and a spline of time to control for seasonal trends in baseline {risk.ResultsWe} observed associations between both short-term and long-term exposure to {PM2.5} and hospitalization for all of the outcomes examined. In example, for respiratory diseases, for every10-����g/m3 increase in short-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 0.70 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������0.35 to 0.52) while concurrently for every10-����g/m3 increase in long-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 4.22 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������1.06 to {4.75).ConclusionsAs} with mortality studies, chronic exposure to particles is associated with substantially larger increases in hospital admissions than acute exposure and both can be detected simultaneously using our exposure models.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traditional air pollution epidemiology studies being conducted in large cities can be limited by the availability of monitoring. Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements offer the possibility of exposure estimates for the entire population. We previously demonstrated that daily calibration substantially increased the predictive power of satellite {AOD} measurements for fine particles ({PM2.5)} in New England, allowing estimation of exposure in locations without monitors. Similar results have not been reported for larger particles ({PM10)}, which are often the only measures that can be used in locations worldwide that do not have comprehensive {PM2.5} monitoring; this also applies to {PM} estimation of historical exposures. Here we extend this methodology by applying it to 2000������2009 {PM10} data from Lombardy, Northern Italy a region with high altitude differences, frequent temperature inversions and stationary fronts. Specifically, by 1) incorporating a model for missing {AOD} data to deal with non-randomness in the missing data; and 2) modeling interactions between land use and meteorological parameters to better capture space������time interactions. We calibrated {AOD} data through mixed-effect models regressing {PM10} measurements using day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random {AOD} and temperature slopes. We used inverse-probability weighting to account for nonrandom {AOD} missingness, while reducing the dimensionality of spatial and temporal predictors and avoiding selecting different predictors in different locations, as common in land-use regression. We take advantage of associations of grid-cell {AOD} values with {PM10} monitoring located elsewhere and with {AOD} values in neighboring grid cells to develop grid-cell predictions when {AOD} is missing. By using ten-fold cross-validation to test the accuracy of our predictions, we found high out-of-sample R2 (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.738������0.818) for days with available {AOD} data. Even in days with no available {AOD}, our model performance was comparable (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.736������0.841). Our results demonstrate that {PM10} can be reliably predicted using this {AOD-based} prediction model, even in a geographical area with complex geographic and weather patterns.},

This feature of {KD} smoothing is especially beneficial for empirical studies in which individual observations are represented by geographic coordinates only and have no other attributes, required by more commonly used smoothing techniques, such as spline and kriging. In the present study, we illustrate the use of {KD} technique for a study of association between the geographical distributions of breast cancer cases and exposure to artificial illumination during nighttime (light-at-night or {LAN)} in the city of Haifa, Israel.},

  Abstract                 = {Land use regression ({LUR)} models provide good estimates of spatially resolved long-term exposures, but are poor at capturing short term exposures. Satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements have the potential to provide spatio-temporally resolved predictions of both long and short term exposures, but previous studies have generally showed relatively low predictive power. Our objective was to extend our previous work on day-specific calibrations of {AOD} data using ground {PM2.5} measurements by incorporating commonly used {LUR} variables and meteorological variables, thus benefiting from both the spatial resolution from the {LUR} models and the spatio-temporal resolution from the satellite models. Later we use spatial smoothing to predict {PM2.5} concentrations for day/locations with missing {AOD} measures. We used mixed models with random slopes for day to calibrate {AOD} data for 2000������2008 across New-England with monitored {PM2.5} measurements. We then used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate {PM2.5} in location������day pairs with missing {AOD}, using regional measured {PM2.5}, {AOD} values in neighboring cells, and land use. Finally, local (100����m) land use terms were used to model the difference between grid cell prediction and monitored value to capture very local traffic particles. Out-of-sample ten-fold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. For days with available {AOD} data we found high out-of-sample R2 (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.830, year to year variation 0.725������0.904). For days without {AOD} values, our model performance was also excellent (mean out-of-sample R2����=����0.810, year to year variation 0.692������0.887). Importantly, these R2 are for daily, rather than monthly or yearly, values. Our model allows one to assess short term and long-term human exposures in order to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of ambient particles, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Although meteorological stations provide accurate air temperature observations, their spatial coverage is limited and thus often insufficient for epidemiological studies. Satellite data expand spatial coverage, enhancing our ability to estimate near surface air temperature (Ta). However, the derivation of Ta from surface temperature (Ts) measured by satellites is far from being straightforward. In this study, we present a novel approach that incorporates land use regression, meteorological variables and spatial smoothing to first calibrate between Ts and Ta on a daily basis and then predict Ta for days when satellite Ts data were not available. We applied mixed regression models with daily random slopes to calibrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} Ts data with monitored Ta measurements for 2003. Then, we used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate Ta in days with missing Ts. Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations (mean out-of-sample R2\\&\\#xa0;=\\&\\#xa0;0.946 and R2\\&\\#xa0;=\\&\\#xa0;0.941 respectively). Furthermore, based on the high quality predictions we investigated the spatial patterns of Ta within the study domain as they relate to urban vs. non-urban land uses.},

  Abstract                 = {{BackgroundMany} studies have reported significant associations between exposure to {PM2.5} and hospital admissions, but all have focused on the effects of short-term exposure. In addition all these studies have relied on a limited number of {PM2.5} monitors in their study regions, which introduces exposure error, and excludes rural and suburban populations from locations in which monitors are not available, reducing generalizability and potentially creating selection {bias.MethodsUsing} our novel prediction models for exposure combining land use regression with physical measurements (satellite aerosol optical depth) we investigated both the long and short term effects of {PM2.5} exposures on hospital admissions across New-England for all residents aged 65 and older. We performed separate Poisson regression analysis for each admission type: all respiratory, cardiovascular disease ({CVD)}, stroke and diabetes. Daily admission counts in each zip code were regressed against long and short-term {PM2.5} exposure, temperature, socio-economic data and a spline of time to control for seasonal trends in baseline {risk.ResultsWe} observed associations between both short-term and long-term exposure to {PM2.5} and hospitalization for all of the outcomes examined. In example, for respiratory diseases, for every10-����g/m3 increase in short-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 0.70 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������0.35 to 0.52) while concurrently for every10-����g/m3 increase in long-term {PM2.5} exposure there is a 4.22 percent increase in admissions ({CI}������=������1.06 to {4.75).ConclusionsAs} with mortality studies, chronic exposure to particles is associated with substantially larger increases in hospital admissions than acute exposure and both can be detected simultaneously using our exposure models.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traditional air pollution epidemiology studies being conducted in large cities can be limited by the availability of monitoring. Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth ({AOD)} measurements offer the possibility of exposure estimates for the entire population. We previously demonstrated that daily calibration substantially increased the predictive power of satellite {AOD} measurements for fine particles ({PM2.5)} in New England, allowing estimation of exposure in locations without monitors. Similar results have not been reported for larger particles ({PM10)}, which are often the only measures that can be used in locations worldwide that do not have comprehensive {PM2.5} monitoring; this also applies to {PM} estimation of historical exposures. Here we extend this methodology by applying it to 2000������2009 {PM10} data from Lombardy, Northern Italy a region with high altitude differences, frequent temperature inversions and stationary fronts. Specifically, by 1) incorporating a model for missing {AOD} data to deal with non-randomness in the missing data; and 2) modeling interactions between land use and meteorological parameters to better capture space������time interactions. We calibrated {AOD} data through mixed-effect models regressing {PM10} measurements using day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random {AOD} and temperature slopes. We used inverse-probability weighting to account for nonrandom {AOD} missingness, while reducing the dimensionality of spatial and temporal predictors and avoiding selecting different predictors in different locations, as common in land-use regression. We take advantage of associations of grid-cell {AOD} values with {PM10} monitoring located elsewhere and with {AOD} values in neighboring grid cells to develop grid-cell predictions when {AOD} is missing. By using ten-fold cross-validation to test the accuracy of our predictions, we found high out-of-sample R2 (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.738������0.818) for days with available {AOD} data. Even in days with no available {AOD}, our model performance was comparable (R2����=����0.787, year to year variation 0.736������0.841). Our results demonstrate that {PM10} can be reliably predicted using this {AOD-based} prediction model, even in a geographical area with complex geographic and weather patterns.},
